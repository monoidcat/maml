@Test.Example

{# There are three major components of an ML system:
  - Data
  - Model
  - Inference:
    - Training algorithm
    - Predicition algorithm

  We will discuss each one of them as we go.
#}

{# Inductive data types with (SMT) constraints.

  These shall provide us with the data model.
  Not to confuse with the data or model as stated above!

  A data model here means schema of data with the addition of constraints. Such
  constraints are necessary to establish consistency in data and establish
  business rules. At the end of the day, it is the model of data, but we will
  get back to this at later point. For now, just think of it as schema.

  Questions:
    - How these relate to HITs?
    - Can we use them as (weak?) homotopy types?
